Price Action Reversal Trend Pattern recognition

Trend changes, break out and break down patterns present opportunities for traders to profit. Price action by nature is charcterised as random. However, Price movements in the securities market exhibit a a bound nature within their realm and linearity with their parameters. Price Action represents movement in time series data. 

Staistical techniques such as Linear Regression helps us establish a relationship between the variables and the response (i.e. in this case the prediction). Linear regression by itself although simple, suffers from other potential changes of data.

To overcome this, we add another layer of analysis derived from data which acts as boundaries. For this purpose we use Open Interest(OI) information on a real time basis. Any contrarian trend in OI signifies a weaker correlation between the price action and predicted response. 

Divergences in an indicator provide an important view of the strength of a trend or imminent reversal. 

Combining these results in a a High Probability Continuation / Reversal system, the aim of which is provide you potential entry / exit points.
